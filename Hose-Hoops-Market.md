Furthermore, the shift toward more interactive and smart products, like hoops equipped with sensors and app integrations, is expected to further boost market expansion. The growing popularity of basketball in emerging markets such as Asia-Pacific and Latin America also contributes to the market's optimistic growth trajectory. <a href="#"></a></p> <p>As of recent trends, the market has seen increased spending in the residential and recreational sectors. The rise of at-home gyms and the demand for outdoor sports equipment have fueled the adoption of basketball hoops in backyards and local parks.
